- **Image Navigation:** JavaScript is used to add interactive features, such as next/previous navigation, allowing users to explore the gallery images with ease.
- **Customizable:** You can easily add or remove images, and the gallery will automatically adjust to fit the changes.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Used to structure the gallery and organize the image content.
